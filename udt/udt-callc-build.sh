# mv_package — rebuild UniData's shared CallC library from every installed
# package that compiles native code into UniData.
# Copyright (C) 2026 Gordon Heydon.  GPL-2.0-only.
#
# UniData loads exactly one libu2callc.so, so native add-ons cannot each own
# it — they must be aggregated.  Every package that reaches into UniData
# through CallC contributes a fragment; this rebuilds the library from the
# UNION of all currently-installed fragments.  Install or remove a package,
# run this, and the library reflects exactly what is installed — no package
# has to know about any other.
#
# A contribution is a directory (staged as $UDTHOME/callc.d/<pkg>/) holding:
#   *.c            C sources compiled into the library
#   *.o            OR pre-built objects (binary release — no source shipped)
#   funcs          cfuncdef declarations, one per line:
#                     name:rettype:nargs:argtypes    (curses/git use string(string))
#   libs           optional: one line of extra linker flags for this package
#                     (e.g. the git bridge's  -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/lib64 -L... -lgit2)
#
# The system base functions are injected by gencdef, so a fragment lists
# only its own functions.  Needs gcc and the UniData generators
# (gencdef/genefs/genfunc, on PATH) with efsdef + libuvic.a in the work dir.
#
# Usage:
#   udt-callc-build.sh                       rebuild from every staged fragment
#   udt-callc-build.sh add <pkgdir> <name>   stage <pkgdir>/udt-callc as <name>, rebuild
#   udt-callc-build.sh remove <name>         unstage <name>, rebuild
#   udt-callc-build.sh list                  show what is staged (and shadowing)
# The package manager calls `add`/`remove`; a bare call is a plain rebuild.

# That cost hours: a guard compiled into the library was provably present and
# provably never executed; an error surfaced from a binary that did not contain
# its own message; source edits "did not take effect" after a full rebuild.  All
# one cause — a stray fragment staged by hand under a different name than the
# installer uses (callc.d/git beside callc.d/mvx-lang_git), shadowing every
# rebuild that followed.
#
# A warning, not an error: an existing box may have a duplicate right now, and
# refusing to link would take its GIT verb away with no way to get it back.  But
# it says both owners and which won, which is all anyone needed.
